# Comparison Operators Practice  1:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool

num1 = 36
num2 = 17
my_bool = num1 >= num2

print(my_bool)

# Comparison Operators Practice  2:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):
# Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
# Inside num2, store the number 5.
# Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.

import math

num1 = math.sqrt(25)
num2 = 5
my_bool = num1 == num2 

print(my_bool)

# Comparison Operators Practice #3:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):

# Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3

# Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8

# Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.

num1 = 64*3
num2 = 24*81
my_bool = num1 != num2

print(my_bool)

#######################comparison operators challenge#####################
# Challenge: Compare two numbers entered by the user and check if they are equal or not.
# If they are not equal, print which one is greater.

# Prompt the user for two numbers

# Check for equality and greater number

num1 = int(input("Enter a first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter a second number: "))

if num1 == num2:
    print("They are equal")
elif num1 > num2:
    print("Num1 is greater than num2")
elif num2 > num1:
    print("Num2 is greater than num1")
